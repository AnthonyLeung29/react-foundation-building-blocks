# React Foundation Building Blocks
A simple app showing how react can be used with foundation and a number of its features such as
-   Icons
-   Building blocks

how everything worked together at the start.

~~May update the community building blocks to be full components with props later on.~~
Have updated some building blocks to be useable components.

Current List:
-   ResponsiveTable
